(Denial Of Service Attacks) is a type of attack on a computer or server in the Internet network by spending resources (resource) owned by that computer until the computer is not able to function properly thus indirectly prevents others to gain access to services from the attacked computer.
 
Dos or Denial of Service is the technique of sending data packets continuously kesebuah sites that want to be attacked, thus slowing down the process or the performance of the website and if access will seem slow. Slow here not because of network users who wish to access a network of slow / slow, but it is purely because the website has too many airport service so that when a user is visiting, it will not be served when you want to access the targeted site.
Usually people who do this DoS arguably desperate people. Why does the author say something like that?
 
The author himself thinks that the DoS users are users who have no other way in pelakukan pentest (penetration testing). Because the average user only uses script DoS another person to perform an action that is not human.
 
Because DoS if used just one person, then the website if sent packets or data according to the author is not efficient because it can still be served. BUT, when one person is a few people to do the same thing then this will be a threat. When some people or groups to attack by sending excessive data packets to a website, this can be called a DDoS or Distribute Denial of Service. If the DoS was only done by a few people, then this DDoS can say we do it in a group or people to conduct DoS techniques to the same target.
 
Explanation
DOS attacks are one-on-one so that only need a computer / host good solid hardware, OS and applications to be able to host traffic to flood victims so as to prevent illegal or invalid user to access the server.
The characteristics of DOS attack initially occur on networks where a hacker or cracker try to exploit the weakness of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is called SYN Flooding Attack, then the course was created as well attacks on exploitation weakness Operating System, network services or applications system even the tools used were the more even can be obtained free of charge.
